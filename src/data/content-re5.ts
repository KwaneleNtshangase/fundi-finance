// NOTHO - RE5 EXAM PREP COURSE
//
// A dedicated preparation course for the FSCA Regulatory Examination Level 1:
// Representatives (RE5), taken by financial advisors and representatives under
// the FAIS Act 37 of 2002.
//
// EXAM FORMAT this course is built to (verify against the latest FSCA
// "RE Preparation Guide" before every sitting - the FSCA occasionally amends
// board notices and criteria):
// • 50 multiple-choice questions
// • 2 hours (120 minutes)
// • Pass mark: 33 of 50 correct (66%)
// • Based on the FAIS Act, the General Code of Conduct (BN 80 of 2003),
// the Determination of Fit & Proper Requirements (BN 194 of 2017),
// specific codes, the FAIS Ombud rules, and FICA (Act 38 of 2001)
// to the extent it applies to FSPs.
//
// DIFFICULTY: Questions are written at, or deliberately above, actual RE5
// difficulty - heavy on application/scenario framing, precise statutory time
// periods and thresholds, and "which is NOT / EXCEPT" distractors, mirroring
// how the real exam traps candidates who have only memorised headlines.
//
// Structure:
// Units 1-8 - teaching + practice across every RE5 knowledge area
// Unit 9 - topic practice quizzes (exam-style, no teaching)
// Unit 10 - Mock Exam A (50 questions, timed conditions)
// Unit 11 - Mock Exam B (50 questions, timed conditions)
