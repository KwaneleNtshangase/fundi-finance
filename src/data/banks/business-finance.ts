/**
 * Bank for "Business Finance" (core lesson: Separate Your Money, Always).
 *
 * Figures verified/stable: VAT compulsory registration above R1 000 000 annual
 * taxable turnover; VAT rate 15%; VAT owed = output VAT collected − input VAT
 * paid. Provisional tax: two payments a year (end Aug, end Feb) for non-salary
 * earners; rule of thumb, set aside 25-35% of each payment. Reuses existing
 * concepts vat-threshold and provisional-tax; adds business-separation.
