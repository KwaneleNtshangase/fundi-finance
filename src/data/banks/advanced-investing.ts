      "<p>Two retirees can have the <strong>same average return</strong> yet very different outcomes — because the <strong>order</strong> of returns matters once you're withdrawing income. A crash early in retirement forces you to sell units at low prices, and that capital never shares in the recovery. This is <strong>sequence-of-returns risk</strong>.</p><p>SA's higher inflation argues for a cautious starting withdrawal rate (3-3.5%, up to 4-4.5% with offshore exposure). Defences: a 1-2 year cash buffer, a bucket strategy, and cutting withdrawals in bad years so you never have to sell equities at the bottom.</p>",
