/**
 * Bank for "Crypto & Digital Assets" (core lesson: What Is Cryptocurrency?).
 *
 * Facts: Bitcoin (2009) was first; crypto is decentralised on a blockchain;
 * 70-85% drawdowns have happened repeatedly and recovered to new highs.
 * SARS treats crypto as a taxable asset — CGT on hold-and-sell (40% inclusion),
 * income tax on active trading; SA exchanges (Luno, VALR) share data with SARS.
 * Ponzi maths: 15%/month compounds to ~435%/year (1.15^12); MTI (~R9bn, 2020)
 * is SA's largest crypto Ponzi. Scam slot reuses the shared investment-scams concept.
