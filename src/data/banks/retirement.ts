 * Two-pot figures verified current for 2026 (unchanged since launch, 1 Sep 2024):
 *  - Contributions split 1/3 Savings component, 2/3 Retirement component.
 *  - Savings component: one withdrawal per tax year, R2 000 minimum, taxed as
 *    income at your marginal rate (18-45%). Retirement component locked to
 *    retirement. Vested pot = pre-1 Sep 2024 savings, old rules.
 *  - 4% rule and 70-80% replacement ratio are standard planning heuristics.
 * (RA s11F deduction cap, not quoted here, is R430 000 for the 2027 tax year.)

Need R30 000/month (R360 000/year)? That's R9 million. The other lever is time: starting early lets compounding do the heavy lifting.</p>",
