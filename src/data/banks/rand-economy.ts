 * Bank for "The Rand & Your Money" (core lesson: Why the Rand Weakens).

 * Exchange rates in examples are ILLUSTRATIVE (e.g. R18→R20/$), never claimed as
 * the current spot. Drivers taught are durable ones: US–SA rate differentials
 * and capital flight, load shedding / growth shocks, the current-account (trade)
 * deficit, and global risk-off sentiment. NOTE: SA exited the FATF greylist on
 * 24 Oct 2025, so greylisting is treated as a past episode, not a current driver.
