For individuals: a <strong>R50 000 annual exclusion</strong> (you only count gains above it), then a <strong>40% inclusion rate</strong> (40% of the net gain is added to your taxable income). At the top 45% marginal rate that's an <strong>18% effective</strong> maximum.</p><p>Your <strong>primary residence</strong> gets a R3 000 000 exclusion (2026/27) — which is why most people pay no CGT selling their home. Example: buy shares for R50 000, sell for R120 000 → R70 000 gain, less R50 000 exclusion = R20 000, of which 40% (R8 000) is added to income. And inside a TFSA, capital gains are tax-free entirely.</p>",
