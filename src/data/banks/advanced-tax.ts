 * Figures current for the 2027 tax year (from 1 March 2026), verified against
 * SARS/Budget 2026:
 *  - CGT individual inclusion 40%; top-bracket effective rate 18% (45%×40%).
 *  - Annual CGT exclusion R50 000 (up from R40 000); primary-residence
 *    exclusion R3 000 000 (up from R2 000 000) — both from Budget 2026.
 *  - Company income tax 27%; dividends withholding tax 20% (≈41.6% combined).
 *  - Trusts: flat 45%, 80% CGT inclusion (≈36% effective); conduit principle.
 *  - Foreign employment exemption (s10(1)(o)(ii)) R1.25m, 183/60-day rule;
 *    residence-based worldwide taxation; s6quat foreign tax credits.
 * (The legacy Level-3 steps still show the old R40 000 / R2 000 000 figures;
