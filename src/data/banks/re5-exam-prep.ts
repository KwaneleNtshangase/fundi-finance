/**
 * Bank for "RE5 Exam Prep" (FAIS regulatory exam).
 *
 * Regulatory facts verified current:
 *  - FSCA is the conduct regulator (replaced the FSB under Twin Peaks);
 *    Prudential Authority handles soundness. FAIS regulates conduct, not returns.
 *  - Register update within 15 days; qualification generally within 6 years of
 *    DOFA; CPD cycle 1 June–31 May (commonly 6/12/18 hours).
 *  - General Code record retention 5 years; FICA records 5 years.
 *  - Complaints: FSP has 6 weeks; client then 6 months to the Ombud; 3-year
 *    prescription. FAIS Ombud award cap R3.5 million (raised from R800 000 on
 *    1 July 2024). FICA: CDD, RMCP, STR/CTR reporting, no tipping off.
 * The two 50-question mock exams (re5-mock-a/b) are intentionally left whole
 * (not banked) so they remain full-length practice papers.
