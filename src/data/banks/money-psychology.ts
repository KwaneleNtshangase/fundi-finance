      "<p>Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky showed that humans feel the pain of a loss roughly <strong>twice as intensely</strong> as the pleasure of an equal gain. Losing R1 000 hurts about twice as much as gaining R1 000 feels good.</p><p>That asymmetry quietly wrecks returns: people hold losing investments too long hoping to break even, panic-sell at market bottoms, or avoid investing at all. The rational response is to evaluate an investment on its future prospects — if you wouldn't buy it today, the price you paid shouldn't keep you in it.</p>",
