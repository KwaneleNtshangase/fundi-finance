# SA Regulatory Figures — Single Source of Truth

Verified current figures for the South African financial rules used in notho's
content. **When authoring, use these — or hedge** ("an annual cap set by SARS")
for anything that changes yearly. Every figure below was web-verified in **July
2026** (2026/27 tax year, 1 March 2026 – 28 Feb 2027).

> Rule of thumb: numbers with a rand value and a year attached go stale. If a
> question's *maths* depends on a figure (e.g. "years to fill the lifetime
> limit"), updating the figure means reworking the arithmetic — not a
> find-replace.

## Current figures (2026/27)

| Item | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **TFSA annual limit** | **R46,000** | Up from R36,000, effective 1 March 2026. Over-contribution penalty: 40% of the excess. |
| **TFSA lifetime limit** | **R500,000** | Unchanged. Withdrawals do **not** restore room. |
| **RA / retirement deduction** | **27.5%** of the greater of taxable income or remuneration | Annual rand cap **R430,000** for the **2027 tax year** (1 Mar 2026 – 28 Feb 2027), up from **R350,000** which applied to 2026 and earlier (Budget 2026, confirmed against SARS s11F FAQ + TaxTim/Moonstone, July 2026). Use **R430,000** in all current content. |
| **Income tax threshold (under 65)** | **R99,000** | Up from R95,750. Primary rebate **R17,820**. Below this you pay no income tax. |
| **UIF** | 1% employee + 1% employer | Capped at monthly earnings of **R17,712** → max **R177.12** per party. (Ceiling rose from R14,872 in 2026.) |
| **SDL** | 1% of payroll, **employer only** | Never a payslip deduction. Funds SETA training. |
| **Two-Pot retirement** | 1/3 Savings Pot (accessible), 2/3 Retirement Pot (locked) | From 1 Sept 2024. Savings-pot withdrawal min R2,000, once per tax year, taxed at marginal rate. |
| **Deposit insurance (CODI)** | **R100,000** per depositor per bank | Corporation for Deposit Insurance, live since April 2024. |
| **National Financial Ombud (NFO)** | Free · **0860 800 900** · **nfosa.co.za** | Merged the old Banking/Credit/Insurance ombudsmen on 1 March 2024. "Banking Ombudsman" / "OBS" / ombud.co.za are **outdated**. |
| **Debit-order dispute window** | **60 days** | Increased from 40 days on **13 April 2026** (PASA/SARB/FSCA). EFT/RM/DebiCheck disputes auto-reverse within 60 days; valid authorised DebiCheck mandates stay irreversible. |
| **NCR (debt review)** | ncr.org.za | Verify counsellor registration here. |
| **VAT** | 15% | The 2025 proposed increase was reversed; still 15%. |
| **Transfer duty (property)** | Exempt to **R1 210 000**; then 3% of the amount above, sliding up (6% > R1 663 800, 8% > R2 329 300, 11% > R2 994 800, 13% > R13 310 000) | Buyer pays, once, at purchase. R1.5m → 3% × R290 000 = **R8 700** (the old "R40 500" / "R12 000 on R400k over R1.1m" figures are wrong). Threshold unchanged since 1 April 2025. |
| **First Home Finance** (formerly **FLISP**) | First-time buyers, gross **R3 501–R22 000/month**; sliding-scale subsidy ~**R39k–R169k** | Renamed from FLISP. Means-tested; must be a first-time buyer with an approved bond, for own residence. |
| **Prime rate** | SARB-set, moves with the repo rate | **Do not pin a number** — hedge as "prime ± your spread". |
| **Income tax brackets (2026/27)** | 18% ≤ R245 100; 26% to R383 100; 31% to R530 200; 36% to R695 800; 39% to R887 000; 41% to R1 878 600; **45%** above | Brackets moved this year (18% band was R237 100). Marginal — higher rate only on income above each line. [SARS](https://www.sars.gov.za/tax-rates/income-tax/rates-of-tax-for-individuals/) |
| **Medical scheme fees credit** | **R376** member, **R376** first dependant, **R254** each additional (per month) | A tax *credit* (off tax owed), not a deduction. |
| **Interest exemption** | **R23 800**/yr under 65; R34 500 65+ | Local interest only. |
| **CGT (individuals)** | 40% inclusion; **R50 000** annual exclusion; **R3 000 000** primary-residence exclusion; ~18% effective max | Primary-residence exclusion rose to R3m for 2026/27. |
| **Provisional tax** | Register if non-salary income > **R30 000**/yr | Two estimates a year (Aug, Feb). |

## Fixed in this accuracy pass (shown-to-user content)

- **Banks** (`src/data/banks/`): salary-payslip — tax threshold R95,750→R99,000, UIF ceiling R17,712 / R177.12 (the "R20,000 → R200" examples were wrong); banking-debit — "Banking Ombudsman"→"National Financial Ombud (NFO)", ombud.co.za→nfosa.co.za.
- **`concepts.ts`** review cards (shown in spaced-repetition reviews): TFSA R36k→R46k; RA cap →R430k (2027, current); debit-disputes ombudsman→NFO.
- **`content.ts`**: TFSA lesson R36k→R46k; RA cap →R430k (2027, current); threshold R95,750→R99,000; ombudsman→NFO (legacy debit lesson, now bank-overridden).
- **`content-extra.ts`**: TFSA questions reworked (annual limit R46k; excess-penalty example R47,000 over R46,000; "years to fill lifetime" 14→~11; 10-year fill-blank total R360k→R460k); RA cap→R430k (2027); ombudsman→NFO; threshold daily-fact→2026/27 R99,000.
- **`content-applied.ts`**: TFSA "who maxes their allowance" reworked to R46,000; RA cap→R430k (2027).

## Still to review (flagged, not yet changed)

- **`content-level3.ts`** — Small Business Corporation (SBC) tax table uses a **R95,750** 0% band. That's a *separate corporate figure* from the personal threshold; its 2026/27 value wasn't verified here. **Verify the SBC brackets before trusting** the worked examples (R14,268 / R47,198 / effective-rate figures depend on it).
- **`content.ts:475`** — illustrative PAYE bracket tops (R237,100 / R370,500) are old-year values; hedged as "illustrative" and bank-overridden, but update if you convert that lesson.
- Any future numeric question: prefer hedged phrasing, or cite this doc, so a budget change doesn't silently break content.
