# Notho rebrand — what shipped, what's left

Branch `rebrand/notho`. Fundi Finance is now Notho; the coach mascot is now Cosmo.

---

## Deliberately left alone

Three categories were **not** renamed, each for a concrete reason.

### 1. The domain and everything bound to it

`fundiapp.co.za` is still live and still the mail sender. Renaming these before
the domain moves breaks things immediately rather than eventually:

| Location | Value | Breaks if changed early |
|---|---|---|
| `src/lib/emails/lifecycle.ts` | `hello@fundiapp.co.za` | Outbound mail: SPF/DKIM are aligned to this domain |
| `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts` | `hello@fundiapp.co.za` | Same |
| `src/app/api/admin/broadcast/route.ts` | `hello@fundiapp.co.za` | Same |
| `next.config.ts` | CSP `script-src`, `connect-src`, `form-action` | Browser blocks your own domain |
| `public/fundi-bimi.svg` | filename | BIMI DNS record points at this exact path |
| `src/lib/viewHelpers.ts`, `pageViews.types.ts` | share-text URLs | Dead links in shared posts |

**Migration order when the new domain is ready** — do not reorder 1 and 2:

1. Stand the new domain up and verify SPF, DKIM and DMARC **before** touching code.
2. Add the new domain to the CSP allowlist alongside the old one. Deploy. Confirm no console CSP violations.
3. Switch `FROM` and `APP_URL` to the new domain.
4. Re-issue the BIMI record. If you hold a VMC, the SVG must still match the
   certified mark, so re-check the certificate before replacing `fundi-bimi.svg`.
5. 301 the old domain. Keep it alive at least 12 months: it is embedded in
   already-sent emails and already-shared social posts.
6. Only then remove the old domain from the CSP.

Social handles still to move (from the pre-launch checklist): `@fundiapp`,
`@fundifinancea`.

### 2. Finance vocabulary

`funding` contains the substring `fundi`. A naive case-insensitive replace turns
`funding` into `nothong` and `refunding` into `renothong`, across a personal
finance app. Every rule in `scripts/rebrand-notho.py` is word-boundary anchored,
and the script asserts a before/after census of `fund`, `funds`, `funded`,
`funding`, `refund`, `refunds`, `fundamentals` on every file it writes. It
refuses to save a file where those counts move.

Current counts in `src/`: fund 373, funds 119, funding 26, funded 19, refund 50,
refunds 11, fundamentals 14 — unchanged from before the rebrand.

### 3. Two judgement calls left as they were

- **`"Mfundi"`** in `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts` (lines 275, 335) is
  a fallback display name. It is the isiZulu word for *learner*, not the brand.
  Left in place. Worth noting it contradicts `lifecycle.ts`, which documents
  that we never fall back to a generic label — that inconsistency predates this
  work.
- **`fundi_user`** in `supabase/migrations/20260417090000_...sql` is an applied
  migration. Editing applied migrations is a bad habit, and rewriting it would
  not change data that already exists. **There may be live usernames in
  production starting with `fundi_user_`** — that is a data question, not a code
  one. Check with:
  ```sql
  select count(*) from profiles where username like 'fundi%';
  ```

## Colour

Sampled from `nothoicon.png`, contrast measured against `#FFFFFF`, not estimated.

| Token | Value | Ratio | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--brand-teal` | `#01A0AA` | 3.18:1 | Graphics and fills. **Never text on white.** |
| `--color-primary` | `#007A85` | 5.09:1 | Body text, buttons with white labels. AA. |
| `--color-primary-hover` | `#005F68` | 7.40:1 | Hover |
| `--brand-gold` | `#EFB343` | 1.88:1 | Decorative only. Fails even the 3:1 UI threshold. |
| `--brand-navy` | `#0D368D` | 10.88:1 | Headings, and text on gold (5.80:1) |
| dark mode `--color-primary` | `#20D3CF` | 11.28:1 on black | Was `#3FB68B` at 8.28:1, so dark mode got *more* legible |

Gold cannot carry meaning on its own on a light surface. Where a gold surface
needs a label, use navy on it.

**Kept green on purpose:** success states (`#22C55E`, `#16A34A`, `#10B981`,
`#DCFCE7`), the `text-green-800` dark-mode remap, and `#34A853` — which is the
Google logo inside the sign-in button and must not be recoloured.

### Pre-existing issue, not introduced here

`--color-danger: #E03C31` gives **4.32:1** with white text — below the 4.5:1 AA
threshold. It was failing before this work and is untouched. `#D6342A` would fix
it at 4.61:1 if you want it.

Also pre-existing and left alone: the back-compat aliases in `globals.css` are
scrambled — `--success-green` maps to the gold token and `--lesson-yellow` maps
to the red one. Renaming them is a separate change with its own blast radius.

## Assets

The `brand/` directory contains a **different mark** from the logo supplied for
this rebrand — three separate strokes rather than the teal ribbon forming an N.
It was left untouched and nothing references it. Everything in `public/` is
generated from `nothoicon.png` and `nothologo.png`.

`nothologo.png` has a near-white wordmark (`#F0F0F0`), so it is invisible on
white. `public/notho-logo.png` is a generated light-background variant with the
wordmark recoloured to navy; `notho-logo-on-dark.png` is the original.

Icon slots previously pointed at the wide lockup, so browsers and iOS were
centre-cropping it down to a sliver of the mark. They now point at square icons.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `notho-icon.png` | 512 square, transparent |
| `notho-icon-192/512.png` | PWA maskable, padded, white ground |
| `apple-touch-icon.png` | 180 square, opaque |
| `favicon.ico` | 16/32/48/64 |
| `notho-logo.png` | Wide lockup, navy wordmark — sidebar, OG |
| `Notho_logo.png`, `Logo.png` | Wide lockup on white — email, PDF report |

## Still outstanding

### Mascot artwork

`public/characters/cosmo-*.png` still carry **FUNDI** painted into the uniform in
four places. These are raster illustrations, not text layers. Automated removal
was attempted and reverted: it chewed the glyph edges, left the word still
legible, and damaged the collar and skirt pleats.

See `docs/COSMO-ILLUSTRATOR-BRIEF.md` for the handover.

### Verification not possible in this environment

`next build` and `vitest` both terminate with `Bus error (core dumped)` in the
sandbox — including on `main`, before any of these changes. So it is
environmental, not a regression. What did pass:

- `tsc --noEmit` clean — every import resolves, every renamed identifier exists
- `eslint` clean on the touched files
- All 8 string asset references resolve to files that exist on disk (this is the
  one class of breakage a compiler cannot catch after renaming images)

**Run `npm run build` locally before deploying.**

---

## Re-running the rename

`scripts/rebrand-notho.py --dry` previews, `--apply` writes. It is idempotent and
safe to re-run. Keep it: it documents the exact mapping, and its invariant check
is the reason the finance vocabulary survived.

---

## Addendum — icons regenerated, category colour fixed

### Icons now come from vector, but only where it mattered

Everything in `public/` is rendered from `brand/svg/` via cairosvg at 4x, then
Lanczos-downsampled. Measured, not assumed:

| Output | Scale from the old raster master | Vector benefit |
|---|---|---|
| favicon 16/32/48 | 0.11x | none — A/B edge energy differed 2%, i.e. noise |
| apple-touch 180, icon-192 | 0.40x | none |
| icon-512 maskable | 0.87x | none |
| `notho-icon.png` 512 | **1.15x upscale** | real |
| `notho-logo.png`, `Notho_logo.png`, `Logo.png` | **1.59x upscale** | clearly visible |

The first instinct — that vector would sharpen the *favicons* — was wrong. A
501px master downsampled to 16px is already supersampled, and rendering an SVG
directly at 16px is actually slightly worse because it aliases. The place the
old assets were genuinely soft was the 1200px-wide lockup, which was being
upscaled 1.59x from an 836px source: the sidebar logo, the OG image, the email
header and the PDF report.

Everything is driven from one vector master now, so the small sizes are
equivalent and the large ones are better, with no mixed provenance.

### Housing vs Education were the same blue

`education` was `#1976D2`, sitting **CIE ΔE 3.8** from `housing`'s `#3B7DD8`.
Just-noticeable-difference is around 2.3, so in the budget report chart those
two slices were effectively indistinguishable — and housing is usually the
largest slice on the chart.

Now `#2E7D32` (Material green 800), ΔE 39.6 from its nearest neighbour.
Minimum separation across all 45 category pairs is now **ΔE 33.1**, up from 3.8.

This predates the rebrand — it was not caused by the colour swap. Checked at the
same time: the swap did not make any pair worse. `food` vs `savings` actually
improved, 29.3 to 35.6.
